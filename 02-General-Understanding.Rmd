# Graphical look on the data


## First ggplot of the data

First, I want to visually find out which is the most prolific studio 
```{r, fig.width= 14, fig.height=13,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#Making a scatter plot
studio1959_2020 <- 
  ggplot(data = studiotop50, mapping =  aes(x = production,
                                          y = reorder (studios, production))) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = rating, colour = rating, check_overlap = TRUE)) + 
#Rating label round it to 2 sig fig and bold
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f",rating),hjust = -0.5),frontface="bold")

#Set up the theme, prevent label overlapping, and create tags.                                                                   
plot <- studio1959_2020 + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Number of Total Productions") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
        plot.tag.position = c (0.2, 0.01))
print(plot + labs(y = "Studio Name", tag = "Figure1: 1958-2020 No.studio's production and overallrating"))

```

## Second ggplot of the data

With second graph, I could visually find out the top average rating studio and its amount of work.

```{r, fig.width= 13, fig.height=12,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
studio1959_2020c <- 
  ggplot(data = studiotop50, mapping =  aes(x = rating,
                                                y = reorder (studios, rating))) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = production, colour = rating, check_overlap = TRUE)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = production),hjust = -0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f",rating),hjust = +1.5))
                                                                                 
plot1 <- studio1959_2020c + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Average rating") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        plot.tag.position = c (0.2, 0.01))
  
print(plot1+labs(y = "Studio Name",tag = "Figure2: 1958-2020 ranked studio's overallrating"))

```

## Further Interprtation

After having a general view of the data, I want to find out the best studios that their total amount of production is above lower quartile and the rating is above median. This could reflect the studioâ€™s consistence of producing quality Anime. 
```{r}
#Find out the mean production without affected by outliers (number of production above 300) 
studiotop50less <- studiotop50 %>% top_n(-45, studiotop50$production)
summary(studiotop50less$production)

```


```{r}
#Find out the amount of studios that is above median rating
summary(studiotop50$rating)
sum(studiotop50$rating>=2.9774)
```

```{r}
#First, find out the studio that the rating is above median
beststudio <- studiotop50 %>% top_n(26, studiotop50$rating)

#Then, find out the studio that the production is above lower quartile
sum(beststudio$production>=49)

#In the end, create the list of the best studio.
beststudio1 <- beststudio%>%top_n(21,beststudio$production)
```

Visualise the best studios  

```{r, fig.width= 13, fig.height=12,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
best1959_2020 <- 
  ggplot(data = beststudio1, mapping =  aes(x = rating,
                                                y = reorder (studios, rating))) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = production, colour = rating, check_overlap = TRUE)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = production),hjust = -0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.2f",rating),hjust = +1.5))
                                                                                 
plot2 <- best1959_2020 + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous("Average rating") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
        plot.tag.position = c (0.2, 0.01))
print(plot2+labs(y = "Studio Name",tag = "Figure3: 1958-2020 Best studio's overallrating"))
